# ShopIT

My Bachelor's Thesis' application.

It uses Django framework for the frontend and backend of the application.

The backend also contains a separate scrapper tool that collects information from popular Romanian electronics retailers (emag - scrapping the html content, altex - direct queries to their server).

It supports user authentication via PostgreSQL and storage for scrapped content in ElasticSearch.

The UI let's users browse for already scrapped content and view price history charts.
